Implementation of the Schnorr for JubJub curve
group using Poseidon as the hash function.
Implementation designed by the [dusk](https://dusk.network)
team. 

## About
The Schnorr signature algorithm, given its namesake
by its creator Claus Schnorr, is a digital signature 
scheme which provides a simple method of creating 
short signatures. 

The implementation has been created using the
Poseidon hash function, the paper for which can
be found [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf).

For a reference to the algorithm, please see the 
[docs](https://app.gitbook.com/@dusk-network/s/specs/proposals/rfc/rfc-17).

**This structure of this library is as follows:**

- Signature Generation
- Signature Verification
